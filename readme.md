# Default Asterisk 1.8 config

This is a default Asterisk 1.8 config that I use as a skeleton when deploying a new server.  It is exactly what you get when you install the sample configs after makeing Asterisk, except I have renamed chan_ooh323.conf to ooh323.conf which is what asterisk likes to look for.
